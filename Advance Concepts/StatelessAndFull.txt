When behaviour of your component depend on state then it is statefull(class) else stateless and function

Statefull -> class in which state initlize inside the constructor

react 15 -> react stack - have its own initial state and it use it to store data and render component
That's why it focus on state and login
class App extends Component {
constructor(props) {
super(props)
this.state = { count: 0 }
}
render() {

}
}

React Fiber -> react 16.8 and above - Dont have initial state means it will recive all the data througn props and not haveinitial object of data
Thats why its focus on UI
import React, {useState} from 'react';
const App = (props) => {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
return (
// JSX
)
}
